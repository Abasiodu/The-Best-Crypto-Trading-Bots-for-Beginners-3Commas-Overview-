# Diversify Your Strategies with Trading Bots 🤖📈

Everyone always talks about diversifying your assets, but what about diversifying your strategies too? Instead of only holding (HODL) or day trading, consider using a mix of strategies for your entire portfolio. One such strategy to consider is trading bots, which can automate your trading and execute strategies that might be challenging to perform manually.

## Choosing the Right Platform 🛠️
The key question is not "Which bots should we use?" but rather "Which platform should we use?" A great trading bots platform can make all the difference. One platform to consider is **Three Commas**. Full disclosure: they are sponsoring this video, but don’t dismiss them too quickly. They offer bots for various market conditions: bull markets, bear markets, and even sideways markets.

## Three Commas Bots Overview 🤩

### 1. DCA Bot 📉➡️📈
The DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) bot is the most popular and flexible bot. You can use it to go long, short, trade futures, options, and more. Customize it extensively, or use presets to clone other traders' strategies. 

### 2. Grid Bot 📊
The Grid bot helps you make money during sideways, choppy markets. It buys and sells at preset levels within a specified range, capitalizing on price fluctuations within that range.

### 3. Options Bot 🎲
The Options bot handles complex options strategies like puts, calls, straddles, and strangles. With preset strategies, it simplifies these otherwise complicated options trades.

### 4. Autobot 🛠️
The Autobot periodically buys and holds assets over a long period. It’s perfect for those who prefer a simple, HODL strategy.

### 5. Smart Bot 🧠
The Smart bot is great for beginners and uses Three Commas’ algorithm to profit from price bounces across various assets. It’s easy to set up with just one click.
